# Weather-App-Vue 

Hi, this\`s a project that was developed basing on  <a href="https://github.com/LoccBui/Weather-App-API-Using-VueJS">LooBui</a> \`s project,trying to learn Vue and secondary development for me.

I have changed the weather query api from OpenWeatherMap to the lbs.amap(高德地图开放平台) api and added a tree-select way for selecting your city to query weather Info.

And I will add this weather-query feature to my <a href="http://www.chiman.love/">Blog</a> in the future.

# Features
- Show alert when city not found
- Find and show weather information of the city
- Two ways to query the weather Info (Key In or Select)


# How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. Install node modules: npm i 
3. Run the localhost: npm run serve

- If you want to build the project to have html file: npm run build
