# Weather-App-Vue 

Hi this a the project that was copied from <a href="https://github.com/LoccBui/Weather-App-API-Using-VueJS">LooBui</a> ,trying to learn Vue3 and secondary development for me.

I`ll change this weather query api to the 'lbs.amap.com'(高德地图开放平台) api.

# Features
- Show alert when city not found
- Find and show weather information of the city


# How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. Install node modules: npm i 
3. Run the localhost: npm run serve

- If you want to build the project to have html file: npm run build
