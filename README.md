# Weather-App-Vue 

Hi, this`s a project that was developed based on  <a href="https://github.com/LoccBui/Weather-App-API-Using-VueJS">LooBui</a> ·s project,trying to learn Vue and secondary development for me.

I have changed the weather query api from OpenWeatherMap to the lbs.amap(高德地图开放平台) api.

and will add this weather feature to my <a href="http://www.chiman.love/">Blog</a>.

# Features

- Find and show weather information of the city


# How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. Install node modules: npm i 
3. Run the localhost: npm run serve

- If you want to build the project to have html file: npm run build
